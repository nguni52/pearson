    <p>12 Map skills&#8195; Globes, maps and atlases Globes A globe is a three-dimensional (3D) model that represents the whole Earth without distorting either the shape or the size of the oceans and continents. The photo below shows globes being made by pasting strips of what are known as gores onto a sphere. When cartographers (people who make maps) draw maps, they close up these gaps by choosing a suitable way to project (see page 13) the latitude and longitude grid from a round globe onto a flat surface so that there are no gaps or interruptions. Atlases An atlas is a collection of maps and other geographic information and photographs that is produced to help us to study places. A globe is usually a perfect sphere, which means it is completely symmetrical around its centre. All points on the globe&#8217;s surface lie the same distance from its centre point. Earth, however, is not a perfect sphere. Maps show us information about places on the Earth&#8217;s surface; or spatial information. If we wanted to show all the information about all places on Earth&#8217;s surface, we would need to have many, many different maps. The radius from the centre of Earth to the North Pole (and to the South Pole) is 6 357 km. Equ ato r All features on Earth&#8217;s surface take up space. The information about how much space things take up on the ground we call spatial information. The radius from Earth's centre to the Equator is 6 378 km. It would be impossible to put all the maps showing all the spatial information about all places on Earth into a single atlas. So, in a school atlas like this one, only the spatial information relevant to our studies is shown. The structure of atlases might differ, but they are usually divided into sections as in the atlas below. This means that the circumference of Earth through the poles is 40 008 km, but around the Equator it is 40 075 km. We call this flattened, spherical shape of Earth a geoid. Maps A map is a representation of the 3D globe, or a part of the globe, on a two-dimensional, flat surface such as a piece of paper or a computer screen. If the strips or gores used to make a globe are placed flat beside each other, as we can see at the top of the column on the right &#8211; as if on a map &#8211; there are gaps through the continents and oceans. Get to know your atlas by studying the index to find out what kinds of maps and other spatial information you can find.</p>
