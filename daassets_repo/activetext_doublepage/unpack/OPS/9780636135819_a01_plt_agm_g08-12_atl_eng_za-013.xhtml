    <p>Map skills&#8195; Map projections Map projections Types of map projections We have read on the previous page that one of the most important challenges for cartographers is how to represent the globe (which represents our almost spherical Earth), or even part of it, onto the flat sheets of paper on which maps are printed. Equal area projections Three basic methods of making map projections There are many ways to represent, or project, the 3D globe onto a 2D flat surface. All early map projections followed three main methods: the azimuthal, cylindrical and conic methods. Today, most modern projections are a combination of these methods, using advanced mathematical modelling. The Albers Equal Area Projection Azimuthal projection On the above map projection, the areas of continents are correctly represented in relation to each other. However, the shape of the continents on this map does not look the same as they do on a globe. The compass directions from one place to another are also not represented accurately on the map. True direction projections Conical projection Cylindrical projection Distortion caused by map projections Whichever method of map projection is used to draw the 3D pattern of curved lines of latitude and longitude (see the drawing on page 20) on a flat map surface, there will always be some distortion on the map of that curved surface. Even if the scale of the map remains correct, the following variables will be distorted in relation to each other: shape distance direction area. &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; No single map projection can minimise the distortion of all these variables. So cartographers choose a projection to use for a map based upon which variable they want to retain as accurate on the map. They accept that the other variables will be distorted on their map. The Mercator Projection follows the cylindrical method. These projections preserve the right angles between the lines of latitude and longitude as they appear on the globe. The compass direction between places is correctly described. Accurate measurements of bearing can be taken on these types of map projections. However, none of the other variables of shape, distance or area are represented accurately. Map scale and projections Small-scale maps of the whole world present the greatest challenges to cartographers because only one or two of the above-mentioned projection variables can be retained. On larger-scale maps (i.e. maps of smaller areas), more variables can be retained. For example, on a large-scale map of an area less than about 5 km2, all the projection variables can be retained with relatively high levels of accuracy. 13</p>
