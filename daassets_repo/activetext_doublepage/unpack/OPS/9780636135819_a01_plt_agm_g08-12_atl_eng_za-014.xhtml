    <p>14 Map skills&#8195; Types of maps Types of maps There are many types of maps, and every map can be classified in more than one way. The numbers given in brackets on this page refer to pages in this Atlas where you will find the particular map type. Political maps show national boundaries as well as capital cities and important towns. Classification by scale We can describe the scale of one map relative to the size of another map; that one map might be either a larger scale or a smaller scale relative to another map. &#10122; &#10122; Small-scale maps show a very large area of Earth&#8217;s surface on a small map, e.g. maps of most countries. The world maps in this Atlas are ultra small-scale maps. &#10123; &#10123; Medium-scale maps show only a small part of a country. &#10124; Physical or relief maps show the shape of the landscape, such as height of the land above sea-level, rivers, valleys, mountains and plains. Thematic maps showing the types of soil in an area and what kinds of plants grow there help us to explain why many people live in some areas (e.g. fertile soil and lush vegetation) and few people live in other areas (poor soil and sparse vegetation). &#10124; Large-scale maps show a large amount of detailed information about a small place, such as street maps of a town, or a map of a shopping centre. There are certain special types of large-scale maps which we are unlikely to find in an atlas: seating plans for a classroom, a cinema or a stadium; or tourist maps of places of interest. Climate maps show various average annual or seasonal climate elements, such as temperature and rainfall. Classfication by place The place shown in the map is sometimes given in the title of the map: World maps (pages 67&#8211;95) Continental maps (pages 50&#8211;65) Regional maps (e.g. page 47) National maps (e.g. pages 26 and 37&#8211;46) Provincial maps (pages 28&#8211;36) City or town maps (page 26, sometimes called street guides). &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; Classification by map use Classification by theme Reference maps (e.g. on page 37) are very accurate maps used to find exact positions of places with co-ordinates of latitude and longitude. On some maps, heights are also shown. Examples of reference maps are small-scale national relief maps, mediumscale topographic maps, and large-scale orthophoto maps. Thematic maps are used to communicate geographic concepts such as: where things are found (their distribution); how many things are found in different places (their density); where things are in relation to each other (their spatial relationships). We use navigational maps to find our way to places. Examples of navigational maps include tourist information maps which show places of interest &#8211; such as national parks and world heritage sites &#8211; or tourist attractions (e.g. historical sites, walking trails) in specific areas. &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</p>
