    <p>Africa Climate Change, the Environment and Human Activities 54 Impact of Climate Change Climate change could result in lengthening the growing period on the margins of the Sahel. Crops will be affected by various factors. Impact on ecosystems and mountain biodiversity could be either positive or negative. Tropic of Cancer By 2050, reduced rainfall could lead to decreased run-off and increase in water stress. Possible decline in fisheries in major lakes in East Africa. Agricultural GDP in western and central Africa could fall by up to 4 per cent. Possible increased rainfall in parts of East Africa. Key Rise in sea level and flooding will impact on the coastal population of West Africa. Desertification Coastal areas at risk of sea-level rise Equator Increasing frequency and intensity of cyclones Coastal erosion Increased water stress in some river basins. Fisheries and tourism will be adversely affected by changes in the coastal environment. Deforestation Loss of forest quality Degradation of woodlands Coral bleaching Impacts on food security By the end of the century, sand dunes may encroach 0n Angola and Zambia from northern Namibia.
