    <p>World Climate Change and Global Warming 77 Projected Annual Mean Temperature Change Decade 2001–10 warmest on record These maps show projected change in annual mean surface air temperature given moderate growth in CO2 emissions, for three time periods, compared with the average temperature for 1980–99. Melt of Greenland ice sheet Arctic Circle Coniferous forest dieback 0 All living things affected by ecosystem change and habitat loss Increase in diseases carried by insects, e.g. malaria and dengue fever Oceans warm and become more acidic–all ocean ecosystems affected Auckland Oceans warm more slowly than land–Southern Hemisphere warms more slowly than Northern Hemisphere 4 5 6 7 8 ºC Higher temperatures increase urban pollution and respiratory disease More violent tropical windstorms increase loss of life Many island groups submerged–islanders become environmental refugees 3 New Orleans Oceans warm and expand, causing coastal flooding and loss of land Loss of habitat – animals and plants forced to migrate or become extinct 2 2011–30 Yields of most cereals crops decrease– increased risk of world hunger New York Los Angeles 1 2046–65 Severe drought causes dieback in Amazon rainforest–increased risk of fire and loss of biodiversity Equator Mountain environments and human activities affected by loss of snow and ice Rio de Janeiro 2080–99 Buenos Aires Average sea level is predicted to increase by between 18 and 59 cm by 2100, with some forecasts as high as 1,5 m Scale 1 : 175 000 000 0 Climate change eco-hotspots Coral reefs at risk Coastal areas at risk of sea-level rise Antarctic1Circle 750 3 500 5 250 7 000 km 1 cm represents 1 750 km Eckert V projection Climate Change Vulnerability Index, 2010 Arctic Circle Tropic of Cancer Key Equator Climate change vulnerability, 2010 Level of vulnerability index Extreme (0) – Lowest (10) Extreme (0–2,5) High (2,5–5) Medium (5–7,5) Low (7,5–10) No data Tropic of Capricorn The climate change vulnerability index ranks how likely a country is to be harmed by changing patterns in climate, natural hazards and ecosystems caused by climate change, and how well prepared it is to combat the impacts of climate change. Norway is the country best equipped to deal with climate change, with low population density, excellent healthcare and communication systems and high overall food, water and energy security. In contrast Somalia, with scarce natural resources, low food security, political violence and human rights risk, is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Climate change vulnerability, highest 1 Somalia 6 Guinea 2 Haiti 7 Rwanda 3 Afghanistan 8 The Gambia 4 Sierra Leone 9 Chad 5 Burundi 10 Nigeria Of the 28 countries most at risk, 22 are in Africa.
