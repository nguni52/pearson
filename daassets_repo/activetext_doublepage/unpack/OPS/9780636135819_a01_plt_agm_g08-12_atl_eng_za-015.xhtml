    <p>Map skills&#8195; The elements of a good map The elements of a map What makes a map of a place different to a picture or a diagram of a place? Good maps will have all or most of the following elements. Map title: A map, like a book, has a title that indicates the place shown or the type of information given on the map. Map frame: The map frame is like a boundary line. Everything inside the frame is spatial information about a place; everything outside the frame is part of the atlas page. Sometimes a coastline or boundary line or the edge of the page is used as a map frame. Direction indicator: A north-pointing arrow printed on the map shows us where places are in relation to the North Pole. We will find more information about direction on page 19. Map key: The map key, also called a legend, explains the meaning of each symbol and the colour shading used to show information about the place that has been mapped. Map scale: The scale of a map tells us how small the map is in comparison to the size of the place shown. We will read in more detail about map scale on page 18. Map symbols Map symbols, also called conventional signs, are the traditional, usual or standard signs that cartographers use to show the features on Earth&#8217;s surface that cannot be drawn to scale on a map. Some features have very important functions but take up very little space on Earth&#8217;s surface and are therefore difficult to show on a map, e.g. a windmill. There are only three basic types of map symbols &#8211; point symbols, line symbols and area symbols (or polygons). On this large-scale map, much more detail can be shown. Certain buildings (e.g. police stations, post offices, schools) each have their own symbol. Conventional colours used on maps Examples of point symbols used in maps in this Atlas Blue for water Examples of line symbols used in maps in this Atlas Brown for landscape Examples of area symbols (or polygons) used in maps in this Atlas Green for vegetation Symbols and map scale While these colours may be used conventionally, it is very important to confirm what the map symbols mean. Always study the key of a map before trying to read the information on the map. The map-maker chooses the map symbols needed to show the relevant information, depending on the scale and purpose of the map. Red for transport Tints of colour on thematic maps On this small-scale map, a whole town as large as Stellenbosch is represented by one circle-shaped point symbol. Cape Town, one of South Africa&#8217;s capital cities, is shown by a small square that is coloured in with red. Thematic maps often use different tints of the same colour to give information about a place. Different shades of orange are used on this South Africa map to show average January temperatures. 15</p>
