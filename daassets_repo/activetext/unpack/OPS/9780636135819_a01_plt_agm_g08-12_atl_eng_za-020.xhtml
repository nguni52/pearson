    <p>Map skills&#8195; Latitude and longitude Latitude and longitude Longitude In the diagram of the globe on page 12 we can see lines drawn horizontally and vertically on the curved surface of the globe. Those lines that are drawn horizontally around the globe are known as lines of latitude. The lines drawn vertically from pole to pole are known as lines of longitude. Lines of latitude and longitude are numbered in degrees (which we abbreviate as &#176;). Lines of longitude, which we also call meridians, run vertically on the globe, from pole to pole. They run halfway around the globe, and come together at the North and South Poles. Latitude The latitude line that circles the globe from east to west around the exact middle of the globe is the Equator. The Equator is at latitude 0&#176; and is 90&#730;N 75&#730;N 60&#730;N halfway between 45&#730;N the North and South 30&#730;N Poles. The Equator 15&#730;N divides the globe 0&#730; Equator into the northern 15&#730;S and southern 30&#730;S hemispheres. 45&#730;S 90&#730;S 60&#730;S 75&#730;S 60&#730;N 45&#730;N 30&#730;N 15&#730;N 15&#730; 0&#730; 23&#189;&#730; 15&#730;S The position of all other lines of latitude is calculated mathematically in degrees north or south of the Equator. Greenwich Meridian All other lines of longitude are measured east or west of the Greenwich Meridian, and come together at the opposite side of the globe at 180&#176;. The Greenwich Meridian divides the globe into the western and eastern hemispheres. 90&#730;N Equator 75&#730;N 60&#730;N 45&#730;N 30&#730;N 15&#730;N 0&#730; 15&#730;S 30&#730;S Greenwich Meridian 45&#730;S 60&#730;S 90&#730;S 75&#730;S Although it is not a longitude line, the International Date Line is another important line on the globe. It marks the end of one day and the beginning of another day, and mostly follows the 180&#176; meridian. (It sometimes does not follow the meridian, to avoid having to cross through parts of countries or islands. Look at the position of the International Date Line &#8211; and how sometimes it does not follow the 180&#176; meridian &#8211; on the World Time Zones map on page 67.) Degrees, minutes and seconds 26&#176;E 30&#730;S These other latitude lines circle the 60&#730;S Earth parallel to the 75&#730;S Equator, and we therefore also call them parallels of latitude. They decrease in diameter from the Equator, becoming a point on the globe at the poles. The North and South Poles are at latitudes 90&#176;N and 90&#176;S respectively. Two important parallels for describing the seasons and climate are the Tropic of Cancer (23&#189;&#176;N) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23&#189;&#176;s). The Equator is the starting point from which all other latitude lines are measured. The starting line &#8211; 0&#176; longitude &#8211; from which we measure all other longitude lines, is the line that passes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, known as the Greenwich Meridian. 90&#730;W 75&#730;W 60&#730;W 45&#730;W 30&#730;W 15&#730;W 0&#730; 15&#730;E 30&#730;E 45&#730;E 60&#730;E 75&#730;E 90&#730;E The lines of latitude cross the lines of longitude. Imagine that these lines are like wires covering a globe. All of the wires together look like a cage around the globe. The pattern that is made by the lines of latitude and longitude, together, we call a graticule. 90&#730;W 75&#730;W 60&#730;W 45&#730;W 30&#730;W 15&#730;W 0&#730; 15&#730;E 30&#730;E 45&#730;E 60&#730;E 75&#730;E 90&#730;E 20 10' 20' 30' 40' 50' 45&#730;S 31&#176;S 10' 20' 30' 40' 50' 32&#176;S 27&#176;E We can divide each degree of latitude and longitude into 60 minutes &#8211; the symbol for a minute is ('). Each minute can also be further divided into 60 seconds (").</p>
