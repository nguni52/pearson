    <p>18 Map skills&#8195; Map scale Types of map scale Large-scale and small-scale maps The scale of a map shows us the relationship between the distance between two points or places on a map and the distance between the same two points or places in reality on Earth&#8217;s surface. If a map has a scale of 1:10 000 (such as the orthophoto map below), we now know that one centimetre on the map will represent 10 000 cm on Earth&#8217;s surface. There are a number of ways that we can show the scale of a map: 1. a line scale (also known as a scale line or scale bar) 2. a word scale or a statement of scale 3. a ratio scale. A line scale is a line which is divided into units of distance. Scale 1 : 100 000 0 370 740 1 110 1 480 1 850 km 1 cm represents 1 km Depending on the scale at which the map is drawn, units of ground distance might be in kilometres or in metres. On topographic maps and sometimes on other maps, to the left of the zero on a line scale, the units of ground distance might be sub-divided into smaller units. These sub-divisions allow us to measure a very short distance between two points on the map, and to work out the small distance on the ground that is represented by that very short map distance. A word scale, which we can also call a statement of scale, is a statement in words of the relationship between the map distance between two places and the ground distance between those same370 two places. 0 740 1 110 1 480 1 850 km Scale 1 : 100 000 On a map with a scale of 1:100 000, one centimetre of map distance will show 100 000 cm (or 1 km) of Earth&#8217;s surface. 1 cm represents 1 km This word scale tells us that one centimetre (1 cm) on the map represents one kilometre (1 km) on the Earth&#8217;s surface. A ratio scale expresses in the form of a ratio the relationship between map distance and ground distance. In a ratio scale, both distances are expressed in the same unit of measurement. Map distance Scale 1 : 100 000 0 370 740 1 110 1 480 1 850 km Actual distance on the ground represented by the map distance 1 cm represents 1 km This ratio scale tells us that 1 unit on the map represents 100 000 of the same units on the ground. One centimetre on the map therefore represents 100 000 cm, or 1 km, on the ground. Another way that we can show map scale is by representative fraction scale (or RF scale). The ground distance that is represented by map distance is shown as a fraction, rather than as a ratio &#8211; 1:100 000 will be shown as an RF scale of ______ &#8203;&#8239;1001000 &#8239; &#8239;&#8239; &#8203;. For each centimetre of map distance, more distance on Earth&#8217;s surface is shown on the 1:100 000 map than on the 1:10 000 map. As more distance is shown per centimetre on the map, so less detail can be shown per centimetre. Maps that show more detail (but less distance) are at a larger scale than maps which show less detail (but more distance).</p>
