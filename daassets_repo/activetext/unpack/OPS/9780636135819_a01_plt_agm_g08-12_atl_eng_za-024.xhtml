    <p>24 Map skills&#8195; Geographical Information Systems (GIS) What is GIS? GIS is the abbreviation for Geographic Information System: a System is a group of parts which work together as a whole; Information is a group of items of knowledge. When used in computers, &#8220;information&#8221; is called data; Geographic means related to the Earth. &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; The main difference between other computer systems and a GIS is that in a GIS, all the data are linked to geographic coordinates of latitude and longitude (and usually including altitude). In other words, all GIS data are spatially located, or geo-referenced. What does GIS do? Data input Data output Data processing It is better to explain what GIS is by showing what it can do. It is used by various organisations &#8211; from schools to government departments and multi-national businesses &#8211; and by individuals. GIS is a problem-solving and decision-making tool that can be used to support such activities as planning, resource and environmental management, economic growth, and sustainable development. On the next page we will consider some examples of GIS applications. At the simplest level, these are the main &#8220;steps&#8221; in a GIS. GIS input Gathering data The most valuable, up-to-date and comprehensive input data used in a GIS come from satellite images (see page 23). Remote sensing is the process by which images containing spatial information are detected and gathered from space (using satellites). can be scanned and converted to digital files which are then geo-referenced. Items in tables (such as addresses) can be converted to point data and given geographical co-ordinates. All the text information that is linked to a co-ordinate is known as attribute data. Types of data A GIS uses two main types of data. Raster data is all data which is presented in a matrix of pixels (see the diagram on the left, below). The data in satellite imagery (see page 23) is always in raster format. The co-ordinates of any point can be fixed with a GPS, using the information about a point&#8217;s position that is beamed to Earth from orbiting satellites. Components of a GIS Data Software Hardware Vector data (in the diagram above on the right) is point, line and polygon data. It is often produced using raster images in the background, with accurate positions of the points, lines and polygons provided by a Global Positioning System (GPS). People GIS Converting data for GIS input Apart from satellite images, many other sources of data are used in a GIS. The points, lines and polygons on existing maps Each of the above components has an important role to play in the functioning of a GIS. Methods</p>
