The sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Capricorn. This is the summer solstice in the southern hemisphere (in the northern hemisphere, the winter solstice). Earth&#8217;s revolution around the sun Earth&#8217;s movements: revolution The sun stays in a fixed position relative to the rest of the solar system. Earth, however, moves around the sun, at a speed of over 30 km every second. We say that Earth revolves around the sun, on a path that is elliptical in shape. This path is known as Earth&#8217;s annual orbit, which is a journey that takes one whole year and is almost 1 000 million kilometres long. The hottest time of the year at any place is when the sun&#8217;s rays are directly overhead during the day at that place. The tilt of Earth&#8217;s axis and the seasons These two factors, together with Earth&#8217;s revolution around the sun, result in the four seasons. Earth&#8217;s axis is not vertical in relation to the plane of Earth&#8217;s orbit around the sun. It tilts at an angle of 23&#189;&#176; (as we can see in the diagrams of Earth on this and the next page). The solstices 23&#189;&#730; night longer than day axis N 6 months of night 0 hours of daylight day and night of equal length Sun&#8217;s rays day longer than night DAY NIGHT 24 hours of daylight 6 months of daylight S Regardless of where Earth is in its orbit around the sun, the sun&#8217;s direct rays always strike Earth&#8217;s surface somewhere between the Tropics. When the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, this is when the southern hemisphere experiences summer weather. At any point in its orbit around the sun, Earth&#8217;s axis remains tilted at the same angle. The sun&#8217;s rays are also always parallel to each other, no matter where they strike Earth&#8217;s surface. The diagram at the top of this page shows the position of Earth during its revolution around the sun at four specific dates in the year. The dates in December and in June are known as the solstices. The equinoxes In the diagram at the top of this page, we can also see the position of Earth in its orbit on 21&#8211;22 March and 22&#8211;23 September. These dates are known as the equinoxes and, in both instances, the sun&#8217;s rays are directly overhead at the Equator. In the southern hemisphere, the March equinox is known as the autumn equinox. The September equinox is known as the spring (or vernal) equinox. In the northern hemisphere, it is the other way round.</p>
