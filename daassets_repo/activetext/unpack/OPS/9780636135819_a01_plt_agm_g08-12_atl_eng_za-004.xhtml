    <p>4 How to use the Platinum High School Atlas The page title indicates that the main theme or topic of focus of this page is the physical features, or relief, of South Africa. A locator map locates the area, country or region being studied in the map in its larger continental or world context. All maps have a Key that explains the meaning of the various symbols used on the map. Use the direction indicator on the map to identify the direction from one place to another. Interpret information from the various photos and satellite images which link specifically to CAPS topics and content. Nine maps of the provinces of South Africa provide information on the key geographic features of each province. Use the alphanumeric grid lines and labels to identify as well as to locate features and places on the maps. All the maps have been drawn to an accurate scale within acceptable standards. Three types of scale are provided on the bigger maps. (For the smallest-scale World thematic maps, a ratio scale only is shown.) For Tourism studies, a distance chart shows the road distances between selected towns and cities in the province. The position of each province within South Africa is shown in a locator map. The labelled grid of latitude and longitude lines helps to identify and locate features and places on the maps. This is the name of the map projection used for the main map on the page. The grids on pages 6&#8211;9 show which maps and other content are to be used for the various CAPS topics and content in Grades 8&#8211;12, for Geography, Tourism, Natural Sciences, Maths, Maths Literacy, Agricultural Science and Economics.</p>
