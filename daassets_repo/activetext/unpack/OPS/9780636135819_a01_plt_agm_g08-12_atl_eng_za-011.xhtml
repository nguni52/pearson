    <p>Map skills&#8195; Earth&#8217;s movements &#8211; rotation Earth&#8217;s movements: rotation axis 1 16 ove r1 Earth spins, or rotates, around its axis from west to east. At the Equator, the speed of rotation is over 1 600 km per hour (almost 40 000 km per day). The speed at which Earth rotates at 45&#176;N and 45&#176;S is only 1 160 km per hour, as the distance travelled in 24 hours is less. At the Poles the speed of rotation is zero. 0 km /h 600 km /h rota tion Because of Earth&#8217;s rotation, at any one time, half the world is turned away from the sun&#8217;s rays. At the parts of the world receiving the sun&#8217;s rays, it is day; where the world is in shadow, it is night. perpendicular to the plane of Earth&#8217;s orbit 23&#189;&#730; North Pole South Pole These four satellite photos were taken on each of the solstices and equinoxes, from the EUMET SAT Meteosat 9 satellite in 2010. On each of the four days, they clearly show the change in the position of the shadow line that is caused by the tilt of Earth&#8217;s axis. At the Equator, the number of hours in the day and in the night axis night longer than day day and night of equal length Sun&#8217;s day longer DAY rays than night 6 months of night 0 hours of daylight NIGHT 24 hours of daylight 6 months of daylight axis N DAY 0 hours of daylight S 6 months of day 24 hours of daylight NIGHT 6 months of night day longer than night day and night of equal length night longer than day Sun&#8217;s rays When it is summer, in either the southern or the northern hemispheres, the day is longer than the night. (The longer hours of sunlight mean warmer temperatures.) In winter it is the opposite. At the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, the tilt of Earth&#8217;s axis means the Arctic Circle has 24 hours of daylight; the Antarctic Circle has 24 hours of daylight at the southern hemisphere summer solstice. On the days of the two equinoxes, the Poles are bisected by the shadow line all day. Rotation and time direction of Earth&#8217;s rotation N to the seasons. S is always equal. The length of night and day at places along other latitudes is influenced by Earth&#8217;s tilt, and varies according The rotation of Earth also results in differences in time at different places on Earth&#8217;s surface. It takes 24 hours for Earth to rotate once round its axis. In other words, Earth takes 24 hours to rotate through 360&#176;; or one hour to rotate 15&#176; (360 &#247; 24). Using the lines of longitude, we are able to work out the time at various places on Earth. Earth rotates 15&#176; every hour. For every 15&#176; that we go east from 0&#176; longitude (the Greenwich Meridian), the time will be one hour later than the time at the Greenwich Meridian. If we go west by 15&#176; from the Greenwich Meridian, the time there will be one hour earlier than at the Greenwich Meridian. World time zones Many countries are so big that they extend across more than 15&#176; of longitude. This would mean that, in a single country, there might be towns and cities far enough away from each other as to have their own time. For very large countries, such as the United States, this is not considered to be a problem, and there is more than one time zone in the country. (See the World Time Zones map on page 67.) For smaller countries, however, for the time to be the same at any place in that country, a system of standard time zones in the world was developed. Each time zone is centred on a longitude line and extends 7&#189;&#176; to the west and east thereof. Every country in the world chooses the zone, or zones, they wish to use for their time. 11</p>
