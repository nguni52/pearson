    <p>How to use the Platinum High School Atlas Where applicable, page titles refer directly to specific CAPS content topics (e.g. the page 54 heading, &#8220;Africa Climate Change, the Environment and Human Activities&#8221;, refers to the Grade 10 Term 1 CAPS content under the section &#8220;Heating of the Atmosphere&#8221; on &#8220;the impact of climate and climate change on Africa&#8217;s environment and people&#8221;). Learn and understand more about natural and human issues in national, regional/ continental as well as world contexts through clear, thematic maps. Map titles are provided for all maps where the title of the map is not the same as the page title. This Atlas contains much additional data, in a wide variety of tables and bar, line, combined bar and line, and pie graphs. In places in this Atlas, topics and themes are covered across two facing pages rather than in one Atlas page only &#8211; so that more content on the topic/theme can be given. This colour at the top and bottom of each page corresponds to the colours used on the Content page for each of the main Atlas sections: Map skills; South Africa; Africa; World. All pages containing content relating to each of these main Atlas sections have the same colour. Use Atlas pages 10&#8211;25 to study and revise: &#8226; the key map and geographical skills and techniques needed for CAPS Grades 8&#8211;12 Geography, and &#8226; the main map work and tour planning topics needed for CAPS Grades 10&#8211;12 Tourism. Use the Index to locate physical and constructed features on a map: for each place, the Index gives us both the alphanumeric and geographic (in degrees and minutes) grid references. 5</p>
