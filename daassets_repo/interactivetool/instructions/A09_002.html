<ul>
<li>	<strong>Trade:</strong> Increasing the amount of trade can help to generate foreign exchange and employment. It can help to grow the local economy. Globalisation is when there is an economic exchange between countries.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Historical reasons:</strong> A countryâ€™s level of development is influenced by whether it was colonised by another country in the past and when it gained independence.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Education:</strong> Good education and training helps countries to raise development levels. Education levels and development levels are closely linked.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Political stability:</strong> Civil wars and political unrest hinder development. Political stability is essential for a country to run smoothly.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Health and welfare:</strong> Societies whose communities are healthy and free from illness have higher levels of development.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Technology:</strong> Improved use of tools, machines and information technology can help a country to become more competitive.	</li>
</ul>
