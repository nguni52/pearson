<h3>GIS techniques – querying using maps</h3>
<p> <strong>Querying</strong> is a way of selecting or filtering data, and is a very powerful capability of GIS. </p>
<p> If you’ve searched on the Internet then you are familiar with text searches. You can do the same type of query in a GIS. These are known as <strong>attribute queries</strong> and give you the same power as working in a conventional spreadsheet or database.</p>
<p> What makes GIS especially powerful is the ability to perform <strong>spatial queries</strong>, or queries based on location. </p>
<p> Some spatial relationships you can use in queries: </p>
<ul>
  <li>within or contains</li>
  <li>touches</li>
  <li>overlaps</li>
  <li>intersects</li>
  <li>distance.</li>
</ul>
<p> Study the image below illustrating using a buffer and select features within a distance of another feature. This uses the &#8216;within&#8217; relationship to perform a &#8216;within a distance of&#8217; query. The &#8216;distance&#8217; part was done when we created the buffer. Here we have done a spatial query to see which restaurants are within the 1&#160;km buffer of Aster Palms Guest House. </p>
