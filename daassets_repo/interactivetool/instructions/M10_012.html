<h3> Recognising relief features and contour patterns </h3>
<p> Height is shown on maps by various conventional signs such as spot heights and bench marks, but also by contour lines. <strong>Contour lines</strong> are continuous lines on maps that join places that are at the same altitude. The patterns that contour lines make represent different landforms. We use these patterns to interpret the <strong>relief</strong> of the mapped area. </p>

<p> The distance between contour lines tells us about the <strong>gradient</strong> of slopes:
  where contour lines are close together, the slopes are steep and where they are far apart, the slopes are gentle. </p>
<p> The difference in height between two successive contours is called the <strong>contour interval.</strong> </p>
