<h3>Working with spectral resolution</h3>

<p>Earth observation data captured by a spectral sensor consists of measurements at one or more <strong>bands</strong>, or frequency ranges. The size, spacing and number of these bands determine the <strong>spectral resolution</strong> of the sensor.</p>

<ul>
<li>A normal camera captures three bands of light frequencies in the visible spectrum. It has a relatively low spectral resolution since it samples a very small range of the available spectrum, and each band is quite wide.</li>
<li>At the other extreme, a <strong>hyperspectral</strong> sensor captures up to 256&#160;bands across a much wider section of the spectrum and each band is much smaller. It thus has a much higher spectral resolution.</li>
<li>A remote sensing specialist will use the appropriate spectral resolution for their application. In other words, they will choose a sensor that measures the spectra they are interested in, in bands narrow enough to discriminate the phenomenon of interest.

<li>A GIS can generate reflectance or <strong>spectral signatures</strong> from satellite imagery. Spectral signatures are the specific combination of emitted, reflected or absorbed electromagnetic radiation at varying wavelengths that can uniquely identify an object. Water, soil and vegetation give a different signature as shown below. They can be seen as fingerprints and are used to identify mineral type and the health of plants.
