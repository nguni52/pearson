<h3>Recognising landforms and slopes from contour lines</h3>

<p>In addition to trig. beacons, spot heights and bench marks, <strong>contour lines</strong> help us to ‘see’ the shape of landscapes on maps. The patterns that contour lines make, and the distance between successive contour lines, help us to identify individual landforms and different types of slopes.</p>
