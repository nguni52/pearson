<h3> Navigating position using compass directions </h3>
<p> In everyday life we often need to give directions to or from places. As geographers, we do this by referring to the points of the compass such as north, south, east and west, rather than terms such as up, down, left or right. We make use of 16 compass points when referring to <strong>direction</strong>. </p>

<p> When giving directions, it is convenient to use prominent landmarks in the area and we give direction of one place in relation to another. For instance, in the map below the <strong>relative position</strong> of the school is SE of the police station and NW of the library. </p>
