<h3> Application of GIS in the private sector </h3>
<p> <strong>Case study: Water resource management</strong><br>Catchments are areas drained by a river or river network. Quaternary catchments are subsets of tertiary catchments, which in turn are subsets of secondary and primary catchments. Quaternary catchments are the smallest practical catchment level that is used for water resource management. </p>
<p> Water that exits a catchment is affected by everything that happens in that catchment. A GIS is used to plan and manage land use, monitor land cover and erosion, and to assist in allocating water to users in that catchment and those connected to it.</p>
<p> For management purposes, catchments are grouped into Water Management Areas, which are managed by Catchment Management Agencies. These agencies use GIS to monitor water supply and demand and allocate it to competing users. Our Constitution gives two users &#8216;first rights&#8217; to the water: the river itself and the basic human needs of the people the river supplies. </p>
<p> The following image shows a view in a GIS of the major South African rivers as a blue line vector layer overlaid by a black polygon vector layer of quaternary catchment boundaries. </p>
