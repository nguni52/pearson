<h3>	Determining intervisibility	</h3>
<p>	It is relatively easy to determine <strong>intervisibilty</strong> from photographs and cross-section sketches, as can be seen from this photograph and cross-section sketch of the Blyde River Canyon.	</p>

<p>	It is a little more difficult to determine intervisibility from contour line sketches and topographic maps, but some basic rules apply:	</p>
<ol style="margin-left:10px">
<li>Two points are intervisible if they are at the same height and there is no higher land between them.	</li>
<li>	Where contours indicate a convex slope, the top and the foot of the hill are NOT intervisible.	</li>
<li>	Where contour lines show a concave slope, the top and the foot of the hill ARE intervisible.	</li>
<li>Even though two points should be intervisible due to their altitude, trees or buildings may obscure the <strong>sight line</strong>.	</li>
</ol>
