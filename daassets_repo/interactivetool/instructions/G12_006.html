<h3>Buffering vector and raster data </h3>
<p> When we analyse a map, we sometimes need to manipulate the data to find out more about features shown on the map. Buffering enables us to do this. </p>
<p> A <strong>buffer</strong> is a zone around a map object such as a town, river or settlement. Buffering generates a new feature whose boundaries are a specified distance from the original featureâ€™s edge.</p>
<p> Buffering a vector feature always results in a polygon. That polygon can then be used in cartography (as part of a map) or to perform queries. </p>
<p> <strong>Buffer analysis</strong> is used for identifying areas surrounding geographic features. For example, in Settlement Geography a &#8216;sphere of influence&#8217; could be seen as a type of buffer zone. Buffer analysis is very useful for risk assessment, for example, it can be used to determine areas prone to flooding. </p>
