<h3>Recognising slopes and landforms on topographic maps</h3>

<p>On South African topographic maps, <strong>contour lines</strong> are brown. The interval between contour lines is constant at 20&#160;m, and between <strong>index contours</strong> the interval is 100&#160;m. The patterns that the contour lines make help us to identify individual features and to appreciate the <strong>relief</strong> of the mapped area.</p>

<p>The map extract shows an area dominated by a series of conical hills and pointed buttes with gentle-sloped, lower lying areas suitable for cultivation in between. The altitude ranges from 964&#160;m to 1&#160;238&#160;m.</p>
