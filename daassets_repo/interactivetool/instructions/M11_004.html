<h3><strong>Comparing map scales</strong></h3>

<p>A map is a scaled-down or reduced diagrammatic representation of an area. The <strong>scale</strong> of a map tells us how many times smaller the map is than the area it represents. Large-scale maps show greater detail than small-scale maps, but cover smaller areas &#8211; think of the difference between a street map, which is a large-scale map, and a world map, which is a small-scale map.</p>
<p>All the maps in this atlas show three different types of scale:</p>

<p>Use the zoom function and notice how you can see more and more details as you zoom in to the image. Notice too, that as you zoom in, the total area that you can see gets smaller and smaller. Zoom out and notice how the line scale on the bottom right-hand margin of the map changes as you do so.</p>

<p>Navigate your way around the map and see if you can identify the street names where the features in the yellow circles on the topographic map (Map&#160;2) are located. </p>
