<h3>	Interpreting orthophoto maps, vertical aerial photographs and
topographic maps	</h3>
<p>	In addition to topographic maps and aerial photographs, geographers also use orthophoto maps to help them interpret and understand landscapes. <strong>Orthophoto maps</strong> are a combination of a vertical aerial photograph and a topographic map: contour lines, place names and other conventional signs are superimposed onto the vertical aerial photograph.	</p>

<p>	South African orthophoto maps have a scale of 1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#160;000 which is five times larger than that of topographic maps and their contour interval is 5&#160;m as opposed to 20&#160;m. They are useful because they allow us to &#8220;zoom in&#8221; to an area on the topographic map in order to see more detail.	</p>
