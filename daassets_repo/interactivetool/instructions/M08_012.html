<h3>	Seasonal temperature changes â€“ interpreting maps	</h3>
<p>	The amount of heat that the Earth receives from the sun is the main reason for different parts of the Earth having different temperatures.	</p>
<p>	The hottest and coldest temperatures on Earth are not experienced during the summer and winter solstices, but a month afterwards, in January and July. This is why temperatures for January and July are mapped to show seasonal temperature changes.	</p>
