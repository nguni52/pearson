<h3> Calculating distance on topographic maps </h3>
<p> There are two ways to determine straight line distance on 
  1 : 50 000 topographic maps. The first is to use the line scale and the second involves a simple calculation. </p>
<p> <strong>1. Line scale</strong><br>To determine the straight line distance between the reservoir (A) and the golf course (B) on the map extract, follow these steps: </p>
<p class="step"> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Mark off the positions of the two places on a strip of paper. </p>
<p class="step"> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Lay the paper with the two marked places against the line scale.The left-hand side mark (A) must be aligned with zero on the scale. </p>
<p class="step"> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Read off the distance value where the second mark (B) lines up on the line scale. </p>

<p> From the line scale we can estimate that the straight line distance between the reservoir (A) and the golf course (B) is 4,5&#160;km. </p>
<p> If the distance between your two marked places does not fall neatly between two divisions, you can use the subdivisions on the line scale to the left of zero to get a more accurate answer. </p>
<p> <strong>2. Calculation</strong><br>The ratio scale of South African topographic maps is always 1 : 50 000. This means that 1&#160;cm on the map represents 50&#160;000&#160;cm on the ground. But we never talk about a place being 50&#160;000&#160;cm away from another, so we need to convert 50&#160;000&#160;cm to metres or kilometres:<br>50&#160;000&#160;cm<br> = 500&#160;m<br> = 0,5&#160;km.<br>In other words we can therefore say that on topographic maps 1&#160;cm represents 0,5&#160;km. </p>
<p> To calculate the straight line distance between two points on a
  topographic map, we would follow these steps: </p>
<p class="step"> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Use a ruler to accurately measure the distance in centimetres between the two points. </p>
<p class="step"> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply the number of centimetres by 0,5. </p>
<p> The formula we use to calculate any distances on topographic maps is: <strong>Distance on the map (cm)&#160;&#215;&#160; 0,5</strong> </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li> The distance between two points that are 10&#160;cm apart on a topographic map is 5&#160;km (10&#160;cm&#215;&#160;0,5 = 5&#160;km). </li>
  <li> The distance between two points on a map that are 17,2&#160;cm apart is 8,6&#160;km (17,2&#160;cm&#215;&#160;0,5 = 8,6&#160;km). </li>
</ul>
