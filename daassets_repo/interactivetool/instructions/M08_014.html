<h3>	Viewing information from satellite images	</h3>
<p>	Satellite images are particularly useful in the fields of weather
forecasting and land use analysis. These are examples of <strong>remote sensing</strong>. Cloud patterns and vegetation cover are clearly visible on this satellite image of the Earth.	</p>

<p>	Photographs can be produced using visible light but most satellites have sensors that can detect different bands of energy emitted from the Earth. View the sample of satellite images that show information about water, vegetation, land use and cloud cover.	</p>
<p>	<strong>Google Earth</strong> uses high-resolution satellite images. Use the historical time line tool in Google Earth, to view how land use has changed in the area around where you live.	</p>
