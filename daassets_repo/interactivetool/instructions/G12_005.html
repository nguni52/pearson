<h3>GIS data integration and identifying layers</h3>
<p>To build up a GIS project, one of the first steps is to identify and acquire the data and map <strong>layers</strong> that you need. Once you have the data and map layers, the next step is to <strong>integrate</strong> them, which means &#8216;put them together&#8217;. </p>
<p> A very important consideration for integrating spatial datasets and map layers is that they <strong>overlay</strong> correctly. All the layers you need must firstly overlay or line up accurately on top of each other and they must be at the same projection. </p>

<p> For this to happen, these conditions need to be met: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The co-ordinate reference system (CRS) of the geometry must be described properly.</li>
  <li> The GIS software must be able to understand the CRS that
    is used and project or transform the data ‘on the fly’ into a 
    common CRS or else convert each data set permanently into 
    a common CRS. </li>
</ul>
<p> In South Africa, the CRS would normally be the South African Co-ordinate Reference System, which is based on the Transverse Mercator projection (also know as Gauss Conform or Kruger) and the Hartebeesthoek 1994 <strong>datum</strong>, using metres as the co-ordinate units. </p>
