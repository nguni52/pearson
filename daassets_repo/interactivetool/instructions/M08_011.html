<h3>	Seasonal changes in length of day and night	</h3>
<p>	The <strong>tilt</strong> of the Earth’s axis affects the amount of sunlight places on the Earth’s surface get at different times of the year.	</p>
<p>	When it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, the south pole faces the sun. Places in the Southern Hemisphere receive longer hours of sunlight and therefore warmer temperatures. The longest day and shortest night occur on the summer <strong>solstice</strong>. The opposite happens in winter.	</p>
<p>	On the days of the two <strong>equinoxes</strong>, all places on the Earth receive 12&#160;hours of sunlight and 12&#160;hours of darkness. Click on the animation to see an illustration of this. Note that the shadow line goes from pole to pole.	</p>
