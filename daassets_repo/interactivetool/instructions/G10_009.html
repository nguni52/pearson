<h3> GIS data integration </h3>
<h4> GIS data integration </h4>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Data integration</strong> means &#8216;putting together&#8217; data and map layers. </li>
  <li> Some important considerations when integrating data include
    data format, data cleaning and quality control. </li>
  <li> Some examples of <strong>data formats</strong> are shape files, tiff, png and jpeg files. </li>
  <li> <strong>Data cleaning</strong> involves editing and getting rid of &#8216;noise&#8217; (data that distracts), checking for valid geometry and checking that attributes are correct. </li>
  <li> Quality control ensures that data is entered into a GIS correctly
    in the first place. If inaccurate data is used that result will be 
    that an inaccurate map is produced. Tests can be run on data to check its validity. </li>
  <li> Data layers need to be at the same <strong>projection and co-ordinate reference system (CRS)</strong> when integrated. </li>
  <li> A very important consideration for integrating spatial data sets
    and map layers is that they <strong>overlay</strong> correctly. Overlaying data is placing data on top of each other in layers in a similar way to which one would overlay cheese, tomato and lettuce on bread when making a sandwich. </li>
</ul>
