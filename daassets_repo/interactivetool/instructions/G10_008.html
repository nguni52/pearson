<h3> Identifying types of data </h3>
<h4> Different types of data used in a GIS </h4>
<p> There are two main types of data that can be put into a GIS, namely <strong>attribute data</strong> and <strong>spatial data.</strong> </p>
<p> The extra, non-spatial information about map features is called attribute data. </p>
<p> The most common examples of spatial data are <strong>raster</strong> and <strong>vector.</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Data</strong> is any collection of related facts arranged in a particular format that are produced, stored or processed by a computer. </li>
  <li> <strong>Spatially referenced data</strong> are often referred to as geographical referenced data. This is any data that can be put into a GIS and given a co-ordinate. </li>
  <li> <strong>Vector data</strong> is defined by co-ordinates (points, lines or polygons). </li>
  <li> Satellite and airborne sensors generally generate <strong>raster data</strong>, consisting of pixels. </li>
  <li> <strong>Pixels</strong> are the smallest unit in which raster data is stored and make up a regular grid of cells that are referenced in rows and columns. If you keep zooming in to a digital image you would eventually only see squares, which are pixels. </li>
  <li> <strong>Attributes</strong> are also known as &#8216;fields&#8217; or &#8216;columns&#8217;. The attributes that make up a record in a GIS describe a feature. </li>
</ul>
