<h3>Identifying types of spatially referenced data</h3>

<h4>Spatially referenced data</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Spatially referenced data is also known as geospatial data or geographic information.</li>
	<li>It is the data or information that identifies the geographic location of features and boundaries on Earth, such as natural or constructed features, oceans, and country boundaries.</li>
	<li>A GIS gives you the ability to visualise and analyse spatially referenced data. </li>
	<li>A <strong>spatially-referenced data</strong> set has a spatial component (i.e. coordinates) as well as non-spatial components (text, numeric or binary attributes).</li>
	<li>It can be seen as a 'graphically-enriched database' or conversely as 'data-enriched graphics system'. In other words, it combines graphical maps and descriptive data in a very powerful way.</li>
</ul>


<p>The image below show the same data set represented in a GIS as a map and as a table of attributes.</p>
