<h3>Direction, bearing, distance and grid referencing	</h3>
<p>	On maps we use co-ordinates to describe <strong>absolute position. Relative position</strong> is described by using the 16 compass directions as well as true and magnetic bearing. If you need a reminder of how to measure bearing, click on the animation. Access the Grade 10 and 11 skills if you need to refresh your memory on fixing co-ordinates or working with magnetic declination.	</p>
