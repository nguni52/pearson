<h3>Grid referencing on topographic maps</h3>
<p>	The whole of South Africa has been mapped using 1 913 topographic maps. Each degree square (1&#176;&#160;latitude&#160;&#215;&#160;1&#176;&#160;longitude) of South Africa is covered by 16 topographic map sheets. Each topographic map sheet has a unique <strong>map reference number</strong> starting with the numbers of the degrees of latitude and longitude in the northwestern corner of the map, e.g. Tzaneen 2330CC. (If you cannot remember how each map sheet is sub-divided, revisit the appropriate skill in the Grade 10 section.) </p>

<p>	We use <strong>grid referencing</strong> to locate areas, places, landforms and specific points on topographic maps. For an area such as a golf course it may be enough to refer to the alphanumeric grid (block D3), but to locate a specific bunker on the golf course we would need to give the co-ordinates in degrees, minutes and seconds.	</p>
