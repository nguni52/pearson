<h3>Uses of remote sensing and satellites</h3>
<p>	<strong>Contour lines</strong> help us to &#8216;see&#8217; the shape of a mapped landscape. Just remember that the colour of these lines and the <strong>contour interval</strong> may differ from map to map. Most maps use <strong>index contours</strong> to help us determine height where contours are very close together (steep slopes). In addition to contour lines, we make use of spot heights, bench marks and trig. beacons to determine the variation in altitude across a landscape. Some maps have <strong>hachures</strong>, which show whether altitude increases or decreases from the contour line or in a feature such as excavations, mine dumps, cuttings or embankments.	</p>
