<h3>Comparing global development</h3>

<p>People, natural resources and wealth are not evenly distributed across the world. In <strong>economic</strong> and <strong>social</strong> terms, the world is generally divided into a Developed North and a Developing South. People in developed countries (<strong>MEDCs</strong>) generally enjoy a higher standard of living, a longer life expectancy and more food security than those living in developing countries (<strong>LEDCs</strong>). Many MEDCs donate food, technical expertise and funds to LEDCs in order to encourage and assist social and economic development in these countries. </p>
