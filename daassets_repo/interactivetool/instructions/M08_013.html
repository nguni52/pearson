<h3>	Satellite images	</h3>
<p>	Satellite images are made from a collection of <strong>data</strong> obtained by
different <strong>sensors</strong> on satellites. These sensors send back information to receivers on Earth. Computers then process this information for a wide range of different uses.	</p>
<p>	Satellite images may show more than what our eyes can see. Human eyes can only view visible light. Sensors on satellites can pick up other frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum.	</p>
<p>	The red, green and blue bands on satellite images may appear black and white to us. Software is used to overlay the information to a three-band colour composite image as illustrated in the diagram below.	</p>
