<h3>Interpreting cross-sections from topographic maps</h3>

<p><strong>Cross-sections</strong> show us a side or profile view of landforms. They help us to see the changes of relief as one moves from one side of a feature to another. The cross-section through 30&#176;S clearly shows that the altitude of the eastern side of South Africa is much higher than that of the west.</p>

<p>In Google Earth, the ‘show elevation profile’ tool allows you to view cross-sections of features anywhere in the world &#8211; go and experiment and explore!</p>

<p>Using the profile tool in Google Earth:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a feature in any location in the world.</li>
<li>Click on the ‘Add path’ icon in the top toolbar, and name your path.</li>
<li>Insert a path on the feature you have selected by clicking and releasing on the start and end points. </li>
<li>Right click on the name of your path and choose ‘show elevation profile’ from the drop-down options.</li>
</ol>
<p>A cross-section of your path will appear at the bottom of your screen.</p>
