<h3>Climate and GIS</h3>
<p>Remote sensing techniques and GIS can be used to monitor the impact of climate change</p>
<ul>
<li>Satellite remote sensing has provided major advances in understanding the climate system and its changes.</li>
<li>Remote sensing has helped scientists understand the spatial (size and shape) and temporal (time) changes of features such as the size of ice caps and sea level.	</li>
<li>New insights are made by the unparalleled global coverage of
satellite observations and improved resolution.	</li>
<li>GIS technology has further enabled scientists to model and process this spatial data to predict future climate trends.	</li>
</ul>
