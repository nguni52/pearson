<h3>	River valleys and spurs â€“ contour patterns	</h3>
<p>	River valleys can be easily identified on a map as they generally have a river flowing in them. The contour lines for a river valley make a V-shaped pattern. The V of the contour always points up the valley towards higher ground. Blue lines on topographic maps indicate rivers. A solid blue line shows a perennial river and a dashed blue line shows a non-perennial river.	</p>
<p>	Spurs are pieces of land that stick up between different river valleys. The contour pattern showing spurs is U-shaped, pointing downslope towards lower ground.	</p>
