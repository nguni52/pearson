<h3>	Interpreting orthophoto maps	</h3>
<p>	<strong>Interpreting orthophoto maps:</strong>	</p>
<ul>
<li>	Orthophoto maps are very similar to vertical aerial photographs, so you will use the same skills to help you 
interpret features on both types of maps.	</li>
<li>	Remember to use the same clues that you get from
examining shadows, tone and texture.	</li>
<li>	Study the contours and the effects of tone and colour on the
orthophoto map to understand the relief.	</li>
<li>	The large scale of the orthophoto map allows you to clearly
see specific objects such as boats or planes. This will help 
you to identify land use.	</li>
<li>	Remember that natural features tend to be irregular in shape
whereas constructed features are more regular and linear in 
shape.	</li>
</ul>
