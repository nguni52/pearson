<h3>	Steep and gentle slopes – contour lines	</h3>
<p>	Gradient is the average steepness of slope or the angle of a
slope.	</p>
<p>	A steep slope has a big difference in height between two places, for example a cliff as shown in photo A. A slope of average steepness generally has a gradient of approximately 45&#176;, as shown in photo B. A gentle slope has a small height difference between two places.	</p>

<p>	Contour lines that are close together indicate a steep slope,
whereas contour lines that are far apart indicate a gentle slope. 
Compare this physical map and contour map of a volcano. Note 
how the contour lines start off close together at the top of the 
volcano (steep slope) and get further apart at the bottom of the volcano (gentle slope).	</p>
