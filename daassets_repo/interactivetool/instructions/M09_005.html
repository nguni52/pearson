<h3>	Interpreting orthophoto map images from aerial photographs	</h3>
<p>	To identify features on aerial photos and orthophoto maps, you can examine the <strong>shadows, tone</strong> and <strong>texture</strong> of features on the photographs to get clues about them.	</p>
<ul>
<li>	<strong>Shadows</strong> help you to identify the height of features. The higher the features the longer the shadow. Shadows also help to identify the steepness of slopes.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Tone</strong> refers to the lightness and darkness of features in an image. Vegetation cover and water features are dark, whereas artificial surfaces reflect light and are lighter.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Texture</strong> describes the roughness or smoothness of features.	</li>
</li>
<p>	Also refer to the map of the same area to identify place names and features.	</p>
