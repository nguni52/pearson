<h3> Measuring bearing </h3>
<p> <strong>True bearing</strong> is a more accurate way of giving direction than by simply using the 16 compass points. </p>
<p> When we use bearing to describe relative position, we measure the angle between the two points in question from true north and give the answer in degrees. </p>
<p> For example, the direction from point A to point B in the Figure 1 may be described as east, but the true bearing between the two points is 85&#176;. </p>

<p> Figure 2 shows the 16 compass points each with their corresponding degree value. You can see that north is equal to 0&#176; or 360&#176;, and SSW is equal to 202,5&#176;. </p>

<p> When we work on maps, we calculate the bearing between two places from true north, but how do we calculate bearing when we are out in in the field? </p>

<p> If you had to measure the bearing of one landmark from
  another in an area such as the Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier 
  Park you would make use of a compass. The magnetic needle 
  of the compass points to magnetic north as opposed to true 
  north. The angle between true north and magnetic north is 
  called the <strong>magnetic declination</strong>. Magnetic north is currently west of true north so the angle measured by the compass <strong>(magnetic bearing)</strong> will be greater than that measured from true north. Magnetic bearing is equal to magnetic declination plus true bearing. </p>
