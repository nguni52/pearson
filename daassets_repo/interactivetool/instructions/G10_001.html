<ul>
  <li> The <strong>hardware</strong> includes the computer, network and peripheral devices such as printers, GPSs, mobile devices, scanners and digitisers. </li>
  <li> The <strong>software</strong> provides the functions and tools users need to store, analyse and display geographic information. Today there are both proprietary (licensed) and open GIS software packages that are available for all computer operating systems. </li>
  <li> The most important component of a GIS is the <strong>data</strong>, which must be accurate. The different data types include vector, raster and attribute data. </li>
  <li> <strong>Methods and procedures</strong> in a GIS refer to the rules or procedures that determine how the technology is applied. </li>
  <li> <strong>People</strong> may include managers, programmers, analysts, cartographers, end users and consumers. In South Africa, GIS professionals are known as ‘GISc’ professionals (Geoinformation Science) and can be GISc technicians, technologists or professional practitioners. </li>
