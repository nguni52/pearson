<h3>	Identifying types of sensors and their uses	</h3>
<h4>	Types of sensors	</h4>
<ul>
<li>	<strong>Remote sensing</strong> is the collection and interpretation of information about the Earth from a distance. Information from space, the air and ships (taking measurements of the ocean depths) significantly aids our understanding of the Earth. Remote sensing is essential to accurately model the environment and map the Earth.	</li>
<li>	Everything on Earth, whether plant, soil, rock or mineral, absorbs and reflects light differently in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. <strong>Multispectral</strong> and <strong>hyperspectral</strong> imaging measure and interpret many bands or segments from the electromagnetic spectrum. They are used in mining, agriculture and environmental management.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Panchromatic</strong> sensors are sensitive to light of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Radar</strong> (radio detection and ranging) or <strong>microwave</strong> sensors detect surface features on the Earth by bouncing radio waves off them. This has the advantage of being able to be used in all seasons and at any time of the day. These types of sensors are useful because microwaves can penetrate haze, light rain and snow, clouds and smoke. They are good for viewing the Earth from space.	</li>
<li>	<strong>LIDAR</strong> and <strong>sonar</strong> detect features by bouncing laser or sound
pulses respectively.	</li>
</ul>
