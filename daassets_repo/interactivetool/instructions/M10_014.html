<h3> Constructing and recognising simple cross-sections </h3>
<p> Locate the 30&#176;S line of latitude on the South Africa Physical map, and imagine travelling from one side of South Africa to the other along this line. The different colour shading on the map should tell you that the eastern side of our country is higher than the west. </p>

<p> While shading and contour lines on maps give us an idea of the
  altitude and general relief of an area, they only show us a <strong>plan view.</strong> In order to get a view of features in a view that we are more familiar with (side view/<strong>profile view</strong>), we can use the contour lines to sketch or construct <strong>cross-sections</strong>. </p>
<p> Study the cross-section image along 30&#176;S. As you can see, a slice down along this line of latitude shows much finer detail about the differences in altitude than can be seen simply by looking at the shading. The cross-section helps us to visualise the actual shape of the land surface. </p>

<p> Click on the animation and follow the instructions to create
  your own cross-section. </p>
