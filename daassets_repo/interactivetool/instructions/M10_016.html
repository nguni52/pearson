<h3> Working with different types of photographs </h3>
<p> As geographers, we often make use of photographs to help us
  understand the world around us. We work with different kinds of photographs, which include horizontal, oblique and vertical 
  photographs. </p>
<p> <strong>Horizontal</strong> photographs are taken at ground level and show a view with which we are most familiar. </p>

<p> <strong>Oblique</strong> photographs are taken when the camera is tilted at an angle in relation to the ground. These photographs may be taken at ground level, from elevated positions or even from aeroplanes. <strong>High angle oblique</strong> photographs show the horizon, while <strong>low angle oblique</strong> photographs do not. </p>

<p> <strong>Vertical</strong> photographs are taken when the camera is perpendicular to the Earth’s surface and they show a bird’s eye view of the landscape. </p>

<p> Photographs that are taken from aircraft are called <strong>aerial</strong> photographs. </p>
