<h3>Determining intervisibility</h3>

<p>From his vantage point, the person in the sketch can see the cellphone tower, but not the log cabin. The cellphone tower and the person are said to be intervisible. <strong>Intervisibility</strong> is when two points can be seen from one another. A person standing outside the log cabin would not be able to see the man because of the hill in between them. Despite its height, they would probably not be able to see the cellphone tower either because of the convex slope between the two points.</p>

<p>Using spot heights and trig. beacons on topographic maps helps to determine intervisibilty, but sometimes a cross-section needs to be drawn to determine whether there are clear sight lines between two points on the map. At first glance, Points A and B on the sketch below appear to be intervisible, but on the cross-section between these two points we can see that the waterfall prevents intervisibility.</p>
