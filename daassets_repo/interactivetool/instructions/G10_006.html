<h3> Identifying active and passive remote sensing </h3>
<h4> <strong>Active and passive remote sensing</strong> </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Satellite and airborne sensors generally produce <strong>raster data.</strong> </li>
  <li> <strong>Passive sensing</strong> senses radiation that is naturally emitted or reflected by Earth or the atmosphere. </li>
  <li> <strong>Active sensing</strong> senses signals transmitted from a device and reflected back to it. Radar, lasers (LIDAR) and sonar are active sensing technologies. </li>
  <li> <strong>Polar-orbiting</strong> satellites are placed between 500&#160;km and 800&#160;km above the Earth. It takes approximately 99&#160;minutes for these satellites to make a single orbit around the Earth. These are also called <strong>lower-orbiting</strong> or low-earth-orbit satellites. </li>
  <li> <strong>Geostationary</strong> or <strong>higher-altitude</strong> satellites are placed at
    36&#160;000&#160;km and usually hover over the same area, as their orbit coincides with the rotation of the Earth so they orbit once every 24&#160;hours. Weather-observing satellites are the best example of this type of satellite. </li>
</ul>
