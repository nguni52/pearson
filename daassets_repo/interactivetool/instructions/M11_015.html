<h3>Using tone, texture and shadows to interpret aerial photographs</h3>

<p>In Geography we use photographs to help us interpret the landscape. We use the clues given by the <strong>tone</strong> and <strong>texture</strong> and shadows seen in different types of photographs to guide our interpretation.</p>

<p>In this photograph overlooking Hermanus, deep sea water has a darker tone than the shallow water closer to the land; and the artificial materials of the buildings are lighter in tone than the natural vegetation. Imagine running your hand over the vegetation in the foreground of the photograph. Will this texture be rougher or smoother than the grass of the sports fields? The shadows cast by various features tell us about their height in relation to each other as well as the time of day. Because shadows always fall to the south in the southern hemisphere, we can also use them to determine direction on photographs.</p>
