<h3> Using map scale to calculate distances </h3>
<h4> <strong>How to calculate distances between settlements using
  different scales</strong> </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Distances between settlements can be calculated by drawing a straight line between the two places and measuring it OR by using a set of dividers. </li>
  <li> When measuring the distance between places with a ruler, you must remember to convert the distance using the ratio or line scale. </li>
  <li> Note that topographic maps have a scale of 1&#8201;:&#8201;50&#160;000. This that 1&#160;cm on the map represents 0,5&#160;km or 500&#160;m. </li>
  <li> This means that 1 cm on the map represents 0,5 km or 500 m on the ground. </li>
  <li> When measuring the distance between places with a set of dividers, place one point of the dividers on the map at the start of the distance to be measured, and the other point at the end. Then place the dividers on the line scale as shown in the diagram, and read off the distance. In the example, the distance measured is 2,2&#160;km.</li>
</ul>
