<h3>Exploring energy production in South Africa</h3>
<h4>Out with the old and in with the new?</h4>

<p>Energy demand is set to outstrip energy supply in the very near future in South Africa. In a bid to bring electricity to every household and to move to cleaner, more sustainable energy generation, the government has put plans in place to decrease the use of <strong>conventional energy resources</strong> and increase the use of <strong>non-conventional energy resources</strong>.</p>
