<h3> Understanding what a GIS does </h3>
<h4> Reasons for the development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) </h4>
<ul>
  <li> In 1962 Roger Tomlinson developed a computer system to manage Canadian land use. He is recognised as the ‘father of GIS’. The speed of modelling using a computer was so impressive that it meant similar systems were adopted elsewhere to solve spatial problems. </li>
  <li> Computers enabled geographers to speed up the process of overlaying information and so the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was born. </li>
  <li> Today you would be hard-pressed to find an industry that does not use GIS to help solve problems. Using GIS saves time and therefore helps industries save money. For this reason GIS specialists are now sought-after professionals. </li>
