<h3>Interpreting climatic information from different images	</h3>
<h4>South Africa Climate	</h4>
<p>	<strong>Wind roses</strong> help us to visualise predominant wind directions. They are circular images that show the frequency of wind speed and wind direction at a particular place over a certain period of time. Each spoke on the wind rose represents a specific direction that the wind blows from. The length of the spoke tells us about the frequency of each wind â€“ in this image, winds blew from WSW for 20% of the time, and from 
the NE for 3% of the time. The circle in the centre indicates the 
frequency of calm winds. The different colours on the spokes represent various wind speeds recorded in metres per second.	</p>
