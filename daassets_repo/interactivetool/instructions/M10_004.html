<h3>	Determining map reference numbers	</h3>
<p>	In geography, we use <strong>topographic maps</strong> to help us &#8216;see&#8217; what an area looks like and to understand processes that occur in that area. The scale of all South African topographic maps is 1&#8201;:&#8201;50&#160;000. This scale is large enough to show natural features (rivers, hills, forests) and constructed features (roads, buildings, dams) in some detail. Almost all places in South Africa are represented on a topographic map. Each topographic map covers an area of approximately 640&#160;km² and there are a total of 1&#160;913 South African topographic maps. Each of these maps has a unique four-­digit, two-­letter <strong>map reference number</strong> that appears on the top of the topographic map sheet, for example Moorreesburg 3318BA.	</p>
