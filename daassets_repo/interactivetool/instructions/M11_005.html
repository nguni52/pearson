<h3>Measuring distances on maps and converting to ground distance</h3>

<p><strong>Straight line distances</strong> are simple to measure using a ruler or piece of paper, but how do we measure distance along rivers, transport routes or coastlines (route distances)?</p> 

<p>You can use a piece of string by laying it along the curved route between the starting and end points. Keeping hold of both points on the string, straighten it out and then measure the length of the route against the line scale or convert it to ground distance by using a calculation.</p>

<p>Another method is to use a pair of dividers to count the number of segments along the route:</p>

<p class="ind_text">Set the dividers to an appropriate width (usually 1&#160;cm, but it really depends on the size of the curves along the route to be measured). Place one point of the pair of dividers on the starting point of the route to be measured and then pivot from point to point of the dividers all along the route. Count each segment as you pivot along the route. Measure the number of segments against the line scale or use a calculation to convert the distance you measured on the map to ground distance.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<p>The straight line distance between Point A and Point B on the river is 5&#160;cm. </p>
<p>The route distance between Point A and Point B on the river is 8 divider segments, i.e. 8&#160;cm.</p>

<p>As with straight line distances, you convert the route measurement to ground distance by using the line scale of the map or the ratio scale if a line scale is not given.</p>
