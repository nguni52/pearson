<h3>Working with vector data</h3>

<h4>Vector data</h4>

<p><strong>Vector data</strong> is made up of three basic data types: <strong>points</strong>, <strong>lines</strong> and <strong>polygons</strong>.</p>


<table width="640" >
    <tr>
      <th>Point</th>
      <th>Line</th>
      <th>Polygon</th>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A point feature is displayed at one particular (x,&#160;y) location (eg. information received from a GPS).</td>
    <td>A line consists of a series of (x,&#160;y) co-ordinates joined together, with each having the same (z) feature (eg. a road or river).</td>
    <td>A polygon consists of a series of (x,&#160;y) co-ordinates that join together to complete a boundary (eg. a vegetation type or land use zone).</td>
  </tr>
</table>
