<h3>	Interpreting aerial photographs and topographic maps	</h3>
<p>	The Five Ss of interpreting information from aerial photographs:	</p>
<ul>
<li>	<strong>Shape:</strong> Constructed features appear as regular and straight lines, while natural features appear irregular.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Size:</strong> The size of unknown features can be compared with objects of a known size. Size can also be determined by the scale (1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#160;000).	</li>
<li>	<strong>Shadows:</strong> Shadows can be very helpful as they show the profile and the familiar side view. The longer the shadow, the higher the feature.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Shade:</strong> Shade refers to the tone and texture.Tone refers to how dark and light features appear and texture refers to how smooth or rough features are. Remember that the tone and texture of similar features may differ depending on the season and the time of day the photo was taken.	</li>
<li>	<strong>Surrounding objects:</strong> Some features next to others can give clues; for example, a school can often be recognised by being next to a sports field.	</li>
</ul>
