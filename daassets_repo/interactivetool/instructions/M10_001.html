<h3> Using alphanumeric grids and co-ordinates to locate places on maps </h3>
<p> The methods we use to locate places on maps are dependent on the type of map. We use the <strong>alphanumeric</strong> grid to give general locations and <strong>co-ordinates</strong> to give exact position. </p>
<p> On the outline map of South Africa we can determine the general location of our three national capital cities. Cape Town is located in Block <span class=green>DI</span>, Bloemfontein in <span class=green>C3</span> and Johannesburg is found in <span class=green> B3</span>. </p>

<p> In order to give the exact position of a place or a feature on a
  map, we fix its co-ordinates. We do this by using degrees (&#176;), 
  minutes (') and seconds ("). Remember that each degree of latitude and longitude is sub-divided into 60&#160;minutes and each minute can be further sub-divided into 60&#160;seconds. </p>
<p> In South Africa, the latitude co-ordinate will ALWAYS be south
  and the longitude co-ordinate will ALWAYS be east. As a general rule, we fix the co-ordinates from the centre of a feature or its symbol, and not its name. </p>
<p> <strong>Fixing co-ordinates on a topographic map</strong> </p>
<p> The co-ordinates of trig. beacon 451 in block B5 on the Pretoria
  topographic map extract are 25&#176;43&#39;33&#34;S; 28&#176;14&#39;05&#34;E. The purple lines on the map extract demonstrate how the co-ordinates were obtained.

<p class="step"> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Use a ruler to draw a line from the centre of the trig.
  beacon to the latitude grid on the right-hand side of the map. 
  Ensure that your line is parallel to the margins of the map. </p>
<p class="step"> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use a ruler to draw a parallel line from the centre of the trig. beacon to the longitude grid at the bottom of the map. </p>
<p class="step"> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Not all the minute blocks are labelled on topographic maps, so you should insert these values yourself as has been done on the map above. Subdivide the minute block into six equal divisions of 10 seconds each to make estimating the seconds easier and your final answer more accurate. </p>
<p class="step"> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Read off the latitude and longitude co-ordinates where your lines intersect with the grids on the edge of the map. ALWAYS give the latitude (S) co-ordinate first and the longitude (E) co-ordinate second. </p><br><br>
