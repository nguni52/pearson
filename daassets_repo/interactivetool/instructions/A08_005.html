<h3>	Interpreting global trade and internet usage	</h3>
<p>	<strong>How internet use has influenced trade</strong>	</p>
<p>	Originally the <strong>internet</strong> served to interconnect laboratories engaged in government research and universities. Since 1994, it has expanded to serve millions of users and a multitude of purposes in all parts of the world.	</p>
<p>	The internet is changing all the time. Social media such as Twitter and Facebook have changed how people communicate with each other. Since its creation in 2004, Facebook has grown into a worldwide network of over a billion subscribers. Cellphone technology has also helped make the internet more available to individuals.	</p>
<p>	The internet has changed how <strong>global trade</strong> takes place. Any business can now reach a very large market, directly, quickly and economically, no matter the size or location of the business.	</p>
<p>	Africa is lagging behind the rest of the world in internet usage, as shown in the following cartogram, and this is having a negative effect on growing economies and trade in the region.	</P>
