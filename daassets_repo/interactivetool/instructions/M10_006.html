<h3> Conventional signs on topographic maps </h3>
<p> At the bottom of every South African topographic map sheet, a standardised set of symbols is printed in order to help the user make sense of the area they are looking at. These standardised symbols are called <strong>conventional signs</strong>. Different colours are used to represent water (<span class='blue'>blue</span>), vegetation (<span class='green'>green</span>), relief (<span class='brown'>brown</span>) and constructed features (<span class='grey'>grey</span>, <span class='red'>red</span>, black or <span class='brown'>brown</span>). </p>

<p> The symbols usually take one of three forms as can be seen in the enlarged topographic map extract: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Point: monument, station </li>
  <li> Line: railway line, road </li>
  <li> Polygon/area: park, recreation. </li>
</ul>
