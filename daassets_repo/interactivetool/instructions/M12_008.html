<h3>	Contour patterns of slopes and landforms	</h3>
<p>	<strong>Contour lines</strong> allow us to visualise the relief of a mapped area. On South African topographic maps these lines are brown and the <strong>contour interval</strong> is always 20&#160;m. The bold lines are called <strong>index contours</strong> and the interval between these is 100&#160;m. The numbers on contour lines can help you to determine whether altitude is increasing or decreasing because they are always written the ‘right way up’. In other words altitude increases above a number on a contour line and decreases below it.	</p>

<p>	Contour lines never cross each other but the distance between them tells us about the <strong>gradient</strong> of the terrain. The closer the contour lines, the steeper the slope.	</p>
