<h3>GIS Processing – statistical analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Statistical analysis</strong> refers to a collection of methods used to process large amounts of data and report overall trends. Statistical analysis is particularly useful when dealing with noisy data or too many datasets.</p>
<p> An <strong>attribute</strong> or <strong>field</strong> in a spatial dataset is exactly the same as a spreadsheet or database field. So, you can do the same types of statistical analysis and use the same functions and operations in a GIS as in a spreadsheet or database.</p>
<p> Statistical techniques are used to explore various aspects of spatial data or to perform various operations on it:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>distributions,</strong> e.g. find out the frequency distribution of ages in the population.</li>
  <li><strong>classification,</strong> e.g. group temperatures into meaningful categories and colour them to make a temperature map of South Africa.</li>
  <li><strong>patterns,</strong> e.g. see whether there is a spatial pattern to vehicle thefts in Johannesburg (i.e. are they clustered anywhere?) or whether they are randomly dispersed.</li>
  <li><strong>aggregation</strong> or summaries, e.g. aggregate enumerator area data (the smallest unit in the Census) to report at the level of a municipality aggregate raster data by zone or polygon, e.g. calculate mean elevation per forest compartment.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Spatial statistics</strong>, a fundamental concept in Geography is that the closer things are to each other, the more similar they are. Various spatial statistics, such as <strong>interpolation,</strong> depend on this phenomenon.</p>
<p> A statistic called &#8216;spatial autocorrelation&#8217; measures the degree to which things are similar in relation to their distance apart.</p>
