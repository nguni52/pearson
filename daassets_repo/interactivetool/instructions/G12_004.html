<p> <strong>Data Standardization</strong><br>In the 40 or so years since GIS started, many different data formats and communication protocols have been developed and used. Because there were so many formats in use, it used to be very difficult to share data. Nowadays, any good GIS software can read and write multiple different formats, and this allows easy, more effective sharing of data. </p>
<p> Some common vector and raster formats that most GIS systems can use: </p>
<p>
<table width="640" border="1" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Raster</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Vector</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GeoTIFF</td>
    <td>GML</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>png</td>
    <td>shapefile</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>img</td>
    <td>KML</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>jpg</td>
    <td>gif</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p><strong>Data Sharing</strong><br>It is a huge investment to capture and maintain high-quality data. GIS practitioners would never get their work done if they had to capture all the data they need themselves. </p>
<p> <strong>Data Security</strong><br>For a government to work efficiently, departments need to share data rather than operate in isolation from each other. For example, all departments need the demographic data generated by the Census. Interoperability is a situation where 
  diverse organisations and systems can share data and work together seamlessly. </p>
<p> Private companies might want to protect their data, in which case, they need to implement security measures. How an organisation implements security depends on its requirements. </p><br>
<p> Data security can also be implemented to various degrees: </p>
<ul>
  <li>read-only access</li>
  <li>write or edit access</li>
  <li>access that allows the user to delete data sets or create new ones.</li>
</ul>
