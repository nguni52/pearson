<h3>Working with a spatial database</h3>

<p>Spatial data is stored and managed in various formats. Nowadays, most GIS software can read and write most of these formats. Some formats are software-specific and some formats are open and standard.</p>

<table width="640" >
  <tr>
    <th>Raster data</th>
    <th>Vector data</th>
    <th>Binary files</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Common, open formats include
    <ul>
    <li>GeoTIFF</li>
    <li>jpg</li>
    <li>png</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td>GML or Geography Markup Language is an international standard and is the South African Government’s official format for vector GIS data.
    
    </td>
    <td>There are many formats but the most common file format for GIS data is the ‘shapefile’.
     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/G11_006/G11_006_R359_SatRstImg_gis.png" width="200" height="107" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></td>
    <td><img src="../images/G11_006/G11_006_R358_PntVDtGISM_gis.png" width="200" height="" class="img-responsive" alt=""/></td>

<p><strong>Spatial databases</strong> such as ‘Spatialite’ or ‘PostGIS’ are where GIS professionals and large organisations store and manage their GIS data. A spatial database treats spatial and non-spatial data in the same way and stores them together.</p>
