<h3>Interpreting cross-sections of topographic maps</h3>
<p>	When cross-sections are constructed on topographic maps, the horizontal scale will always be 1&#8201;:&#8201;50&#160;000. The vertical scale, however, varies from cross-section to cross-section. This means that the vertical exaggeration of cross-sections will also differ.	</p>
<p>	It is important to determine the &#8216;to&#8217; and the &#8216;from&#8217; place when constructing cross-sections. If you start at the incorrect point, you will produce a mirror image of the expected cross-section. These cross-sections were both constructed along line Aâ€“B: the first was constructed from point A to point B and the second from point B to point A.	</p>

<p>	In addition to constructing the actual profile, you may also be required to insert selected natural and constructed features onto your cross-section. Alternatively you may be asked to identify features on a given cross-section.	</p>
