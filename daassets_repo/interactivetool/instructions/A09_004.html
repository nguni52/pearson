<h3>	South African energy resources	</h3>
<p>	<strong>Use of resources â€“ renewable and non-renewable energy</strong>	</p>
<p>	Energy resources fall into two categories: non-renewable and
renewable. Non-renewable energy resources, such as coal, nuclear, oil and natural gas, are available in limited supplies. This is usually due to the long time it takes for them to be replenished.	</p>
<p>	Renewable resources are replenished naturally and over relatively short periods of time. The five major renewable energy resources are solar, wind, water (hydro), biomass and geothermal. South Africa uses a mix of both renewable and non-renewable energy sources.	</p>
