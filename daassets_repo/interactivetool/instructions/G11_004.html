<h3>Working with raster data</h3>

<h4>Raster data</h4>

<p>Satellite and airborne sensors generally generate <strong>raster</strong> data, consisting of <strong>pixels</strong> that store measured values of a phenomenon (usually surface reflectance) as it varies across the Earthâ€™s surface. Raster data generated this way is like a picture taken with a digital camera.</p>

<p>Raster data can also represent any phenomenon or value in its pixels. A very common and very useful application of raster data is in <strong>DEMs</strong> or Digital Elevation Models, in which each pixel represents elevation. </p>

<p>The natural vegetation map on page&#160;53 in the atlas is most likely generated from raster data from Landsat imagery similar to that below.</p>
