    <p>22 Map skills&#8195; Aerial photographs Oblique and vertical aerial photos When photos are taken from the air, with the camera pointing out the side of the aeroplane, the view of the ground in the photos is oblique. These oblique aerial photos (below on the right) cannot be used for map-making. Getting height information from photos It is possible to look at two vertical aerial photos together and to get a three-dimensional (3D) view of the landscape. The height differences seen from these 3D visual models are used to draw contour lines on maps. Rectification Photos taken with the camera underneath the plane, pointing vertically down towards the ground, are known as vertical aerial photos (above on the left). They help significantly to draw accurate maps. Multiple views of the same landscape feature also make it possible to produce rectified photo images. &#8220;Rectified&#8221; means that the scale of a photo has been corrected so that the image has the same scale in all directions. How to interpret aerial photos To identify features on vertical aerial photos, it is important to study the following elements of the photos: shadow, shape, size, pattern, texture and tone. Pattern &#8211; Repeated shapes and lines form patterns. In an urban area, we can easily recognise different street patterns such as grid, radial or irregular patterns. Size &#8211; In urban areas, small houses on small plots suggest low or middle-income suburbs, while large houses on large plots suggest a high-income residential area. Tone &#8211; Differences between light and dark tones on black and white photos are caused by the different amounts of light which are reflected by features on the ground. Surfaces that reflect light appear almost white, while surfaces that absorb light appear almost black. A mature maize crop ready for harvesting appears lighter on an aerial photo than darker green plants such as potatoes. Dry, sandy soil appears lighter than rich, fertile soil. On colour photos, lighter and darker shades of different colours help us get even more details about what is actually on the ground in those photos. Size &#8211; In a rural area, large fields indicate commercial farming. Many small fields might show subsistence farming, or intensive market gardening. Shadow &#8211; In the same way that adding shadow to maps helps to show relief (see page 16), studying shadows on aerial photos helps us to identify mountains and hills. In urban areas, the shadows cast by buildings and towers help us to compare their heights &#8211; long shadows indicate tall structures. Texture &#8211; Surface texture can be described as rough (where there are treetops or rocks and boulders), smooth (where there is water or a field of wheat) or ridged (where there are plants in rows, especially orchards or vineyards). Shape &#8211; Straight lines and rectangular shapes indicate constructed features such as roads and buildings. Irregular, curved lines indicate natural features such as rivers and coastlines. Pattern &#8211; Repeated shapes and lines form patterns. In a rural area, parallel rows of trees indicate orchards or plantations.</p>
