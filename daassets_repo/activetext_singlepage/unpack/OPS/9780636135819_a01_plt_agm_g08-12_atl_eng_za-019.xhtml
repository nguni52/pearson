    <p>Map skills&#8195;Direction The cardinal points of direction When we need to explain to someone how to find a place, we use direction to describe where the place is that the person needs to find, relative to where they are. This is known as relative position. One way to describe direction is to use a compass. We also most commonly describe direction in terms of the four cardinal (or main) points of direction: north, south, east and west. In geography, navigation and travel, we often need to give direction more accurately than with these four cardinal W E points only. To give a direction which lies halfway between two cardinal points, e.g. between north and S east, we join the words of those two cardinal points together, &#8220;northeast&#8221;. The four intercardinal (or sub-cardinal) compass points are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW) and northwest (NW). N N NW NNW NNE WNW NE ENE W E WSW SW ESE SSW SSE SE On the compass card on the left, we can see how the four cardinal points and four subcardinal points can be sub-divided even further, giving us another eight points of direction. The Magnetic North Pole is the place to which the magnetic needle of a compass points. This direction is known as Magnetic North. Magnetic North is continually moving &#8211; although very slowly &#8211; due to the activity of Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. Magnetic North currently lies in northern Canada. The South African 1: 50 000 topographic maps show both Magnetic North as well as True North direction indicators. Direction and bearing We have already read above about relative position, and how we describe for a person the direction from one place (where that person is) to another place (the place that person needs to find). There is a second, more accurate method that we can use to state relative position. We can measure relative position, using an angle. We state bearing as an angle from one place to another; we can say that one place is on a bearing of a specified angle (e.g. 90&#176;) from another place. Magnetic declination The angle between Magnetic North and True North is called the magnetic declination. It is abbreviated as D. From different parts of the world, Magnetic North might lie either to the west or to the east of True North. Where Magnetic North lies to the west of True North, we say the magnetic declination is negative. (From everywhere in South Africa, the magnetic declination is negative.) Where Magnetic North lies to the east of True North (such as in Australia), the magnetic declination is positive. Magnetic North (compass) True North (geographic) &#8211;D N S NW NE True north and magnetic north In the section on latitude and longitude on the next page, we will see that all lines of longitude meet (converge) at the North Pole. That point on Earth&#8217;s surface is known as True North. The magnetic needle of a compass does not point to True North. Earth is like a magnet, in that Earth has its own, weak magnetic field. Like the bar magnets used in Science classes, Earth also has magnetic poles. The two points on Earth&#8217;s surface which are right above the two poles of Earth&#8217;s &#8220;magnet&#8221; are called the Magnetic North Pole and the Magnetic South Pole.
