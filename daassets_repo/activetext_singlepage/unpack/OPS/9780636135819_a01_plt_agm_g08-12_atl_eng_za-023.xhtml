    <p>Map skills&#8195; Satellite images Satellites &#8211; the view from above The very best way to get a really good view of a place is to go up very high and look down on it. These days, Earth Observation (EO) satellites in space orbiting Earth get even better views of very large areas of Earth&#8217;s surface than we get from vertical aerial photos. Any image (of a portion of Earth&#8217;s surface) that is captured by the sensors carried by a satellite in orbit, and subsequently transferred to a control station on the ground for processing, is called a satellite image. direction of Earth&#8217;s rotation satellite area recorded by the satellite Satellite image resolution Each EO sensor is programmed to gather energy data from a predetermined area on the ground, called a footprint. If this footprint covers a large area, the image will have a low spatial resolution. Once the data is processed for viewing, the resulting image will not be very clear, such as in the 29,5 m resolution image on the left below. (The resolution of the image on the right is 0,8 m.) satellite Every satellite image is coded with the geographic co-ordinates and altitude of the position of the image in relation to the Earth&#8217;s surface. Every point on the satellite image has coordinates in degrees, minutes and seconds (measured very accurately to many decimal places). How satellite images are made Satellite images (like images captured with digital cameras) are captured electronically onto a matrix (a very fine grid) made up of thousands of pixels. A pixel (&#8220;pix-&#8221; for picture, &#8220;-el&#8221; for element) is the fundamental display element of an electronic screen. Digital cameras electronically record light energy from only the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the sensors on satellites can detect energy from both the visible and non-visible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared energy (or heat) and ultraviolet energy (emitted from different mineral compounds). Sometimes the satellite images produced are true-colour images (the image on the left, above), which look like ordinary photos. These are not always as useful for Earth Observation purposes as images which have recorded energy (such as heat energy or moisture content) that is not usually visible. The smaller the footprint, the higher the spatial resolution of the image, and the clearer the image will be (as in the 56 m resolution image above). Images with a spatial resolution less than 1 m (i.e. 1 m x 1 m) can be used to make accurate, large-scale maps. visible light path of the satellite around Earth For the non-visible energy data captured to be made visible and understood on satellite images, a variety of colours can be added to the data. In some cases this leads to what are called &#8220;false-colour&#8221; satellite images (see the image in the bottom left of this page). The image at the very bottom is a false-colour satellite image. Like a good map, a satellite image should have a colour-coded key to explain the colours that have been used to show the data. radio waves microwave long wavelength low energy low frequency infrared ultraviolet x-rays gamma waves short wavelength high energy high frequency The electromagnetic spectrum represents the various bands from which energy can be detected. Spectral resolution refers to the number of different bands in the electromagnetic spectrum detected by the sensor. This may be equivalent to the number of sensors carried on the satellite. The greater the number of bands detected, the higher will be the spectral resolution of the satellite image. 23</p>
