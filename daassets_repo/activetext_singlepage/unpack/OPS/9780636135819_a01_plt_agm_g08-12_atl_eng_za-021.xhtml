    <p>Map skills&#8195; Locating exact position &#8211; co-ordinates How to give our position using relative or absolute location Co-ordinates in degrees, minutes and seconds We read on page 19 about using relative position or relative location to give our position in a town or village by describing the direction from where we are to landmarks such as shops, libraries, petrol stations or even street corners. The most accurate way to give our position is not by referring to other landmarks, but by using latitude and longitude. This is called absolute position (or location). How to find the position of places or features on a globe or on a flat map One way to locate (find the position of ) things and places on a flat map is by using an alpha-numeric grid of squares. On a round globe, however, that grid of squares will not work. We can use the grid system of latitude and longitude lines referred to on page 20 to state very accurately the position of any thing or place on a globe, or on the actual Earth. As long as the map shows latitude and longitude lines, we can use co-ordinates to find the location of a place or feature also on a flat map. On small-scale maps of the world (above on the left) &#8211; where only every 10&#176; or 20&#176; line might be shown &#8211; we use co-ordinates in degrees only to describe the location of a place. On larger-scale maps of our local area (above on the right), we need to use co-ordinates in degrees, minutes and even possibly in seconds if we want to describe more accurately the location of a feature or place. Co-ordinates To locate a place on a globe (or on Earth&#8217;s surface), we first describe how far that place is from the Equator. We state the value of the latitude line that passes closest to that place. After the value we indicate by the abbreviation &#8220;N&#8221; or &#8220;S&#8221; whether that line is in the northern or the southern hemisphere. Next, we give the value for the longitude line which crosses the latitude line closest to the place. We indicate after the value by &#8220;E&#8221; or &#8220;W&#8221; whether that longitude line is in the eastern or western hemisphere. When we give the values of the lines of both latitude and longitude that are closest to the place on the globe, we are stating the co-ordinates of that place. To calculate the co-ordinates of a place on a map that falls between grid lines of latitude and longitude, we have to estimate the distance of the place from the nearest grid lines. We can estimate this more accurately on larger-scale maps, on which there are fewer degrees of interval between the grid lines. On the left-hand map above, we estimate Albert Falls to lie about halfway between the 29&#176;S and 30&#176;S latitude lines, and about halfway between the 30&#176;E and 31&#176;E longitude lines. On the map the interval between each grid line is only one degree, or 60 minutes. So we can estimate quite accurately the co-ordinates for Albert Falls to be: 29&#189;&#176;S (or 29&#176;30'S), 30&#189;&#176;E (or 30&#176;30'E). On the map above on the right it is more difficult to gauge the exact number of degrees of the co-ordinates of Beaufort West because there is an interval of 5&#176; between the grid lines. To locate places on maps in this Atlas, we can use the Atlas Index and the co-ordinates of places listed in the Index. 21</p>
