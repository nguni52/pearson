    <p>Map skills&#8195; Geographical Information Systems (GIS) GIS processing GIS data layers vector As the various kinds of data in a GIS are all geo-referenced, the data can be compared and contrasted, making use of different GIS layers. raster customers streets property boundaries slope land usage real world latit ude e itud ong l In a GIS, the data gathered can be displayed in a range of layers. For example, a GIS can use selected layers of data to locate new businesses or to track environmental degradation. A GIS helps to route rubbish trucks, and to manage the paving of roads; it helps marketers find new customers, and it helps farmers grow healthier, larger crops. The various layers of data in a GIS make it possible for us to create maps specific to our needs. Network analysis Topographic analysis Incident mapping Isolines Spatial measurement Demographic analysis Transportation modelling Site selection Logistics routing Watershed analysis Spread and diffusion Land management With GIS being such a powerful tool for processing and analysing data, there are many and varied ways in which GIS can be used. GIS output Weather and GIS Forests and GIS Weather affects us in many critical ways, e.g. drought results in water shortages, increased potential for wildfires, and damage to crops. Meteorologists gather and analyse information on atmospheric conditions, including from satellite images such as this one showing cloud patterns. Foresters use GIS to manage their plantations; to know where which blocks of trees can be planted (slope angles, road access, soil types) and how old the trees are in each block (to help to decide when each block can be harvested). Foresters also use GIS as a tool to conduct research, such as how to use organisms like mycorrhiza to enhance tree growth. This essential information is applied using GIS in agriculture, airpollution control, air and sea transportation, and in the study of trends in Earth&#8217;s climate such as global warming. Water and GIS Suitable sites for dams can be chosen with a GIS, using data from satellite imagery to identify drainage basin capacity and the stability of underlying rock strata. Water from the dam is supplied via a pipe network that is built and maintained using information in a GIS. Electricity and GIS Electricity is mostly generated in South Africa using coal. Coal deposits are found using satellite imagery. Coal-mining infrastructure, and routes to transport the coal, are planned, constructed, managed and mapped using GIS. The network of ESKOM power lines is maintained using GIS. Four maps were combined (Climate, Phosphorous levels, Soil texture, Soil Ph) to find favourable geographic locations for using different mycorrhiza with selected tree species. Population, crime and GIS GIS was used by the police on the Cape Flats to get an understanding of crime. Analysis revealed that in the less affluent areas, crime against people (stabbings, murders, assault, etc.) were higher; in the more affluent areas, crime against property (house breakings, car theft, etc.) was more prominent.
