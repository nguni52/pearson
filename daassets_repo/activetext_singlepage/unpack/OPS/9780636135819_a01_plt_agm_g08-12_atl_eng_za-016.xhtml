    <p>16 Map skills&#8195; Height clues on maps How height is shown on maps Maps represent places. Although maps are flat, the places they represent are most often not flat. Cartographers use many different methods to show the rise and fall of the landscape. route are shown. This is done using a small arrowhead, with the height behind the point of the arrow. (See the 386.1 and 371.7 heights next to the &#8220;N2&#8221; symbol.) By comparing heights along a route, we can easily see if the route is going uphill or downhill. Hachures One of the earliest methods used to show relief was to draw lines from the top to the bottom of each slope. This method is still used today to show mine dumps (below on the right). Spot heights Peak heights The highest point of a hill or a mountain is called the peak. A triangular point symbol &#9650; is used on maps to show the position and height of the peak of a hill or a mountain. On small-scale country maps, as shown below, the triangle usually has a black fill. The number close to the triangle is the height of the peak. When surveyors measure the heights of places, and the distances between places on the ground, each place where they take measurements is known as a spot height. Many thousands of these spot heights are measured; some of them are marked on the maps which are made using surveyors&#8217; measurements. On a map, a spot height consists of a dot with a height measurement beside it. Hypsometric tints On small-scale relief maps of countries or continents, different colours can be used to represent land at different heights. Places close to sea level are usually shaded green. As the height of places increases, the colours used range from pale orange to brown and then to purple. The colour tints become more intense (darker) as height measurements increase. Trigonometric beacons On topographic maps, the black triangle showing height is not filled. The centre of each triangle marks the position of the highest point in the surrounding landscape. station number 46 1499.2 height in metres The height of the point is given below the triangle. The registered number of the trigonometric station used by surveyors to take measurements of both the height of the ground and the distance between beacons appears alongside. A white beacon as shown in the photo is built at each trigonometric station. Bench marks Before roads or railways can be built, surveyors carefully measure the slopes of the land that these transport routes will have to follow. Once the road or railway has been built and is shown on a map, the heights of significant points along the The use of hypsometric tinting only (left) and with hill shading (right) to show height on maps. Hill shading Another way to represent relief on a map is by light and dark shading (see the sample map, above, on the right). Slopes which face towards the sun are shaded lighter. Darker shading is used to represent the shadows cast by hills and mountains. With modern digital imagery, the shadows are generated using slope information. Very effective 3D views of the landscape can be produced in this way.</p>
