    <p>Map skills&#8195; Contours and landforms Contour lines The method used to show height on topographic maps &#8211; as well as to show landforms &#8211; is by contour lines. They join all places of equal height above mean sea level. Some contour lines are drawn slightly thicker than the others (on 1:50 000 topographic maps, at 100 m intervals). Where slopes are very steep, these darker index contours make it easier for us to read the height values. Contour lines that are close to each other show steep slopes; the closer the lines are, the steeper the slope. Contour lines that are far apart show gentle slopes; the further apart the lines are, the gentler the slope. The numbers that show the height readings on contour lines always appear as if they are written &#8220;on&#8221; the slope. That is, the top of the number corresponds with the top of the slope. The constant height difference between contour lines is called the contour interval. Contour patterns and landforms Individual contour lines on a map show us very little information about the relief of the landscape. It is the patterns formed by all the contour lines together which provide the height information necessary for us to understand what an area really looks like. The slope from the bottom to the top of a landform is seldom a straight line. As a slope changes from one angle to another, each section of the slope is known as a slope element. The slope of each element is measured relative to the horizontal. A perfectly flat landscape has a horizontal surface and is described as a 0&#176; slope. Any landform that rises above a flat surface forms a slope (gradient = 1:&#8729;) that can be measured relative to the horizontal as an angle somewhere between 0&#176; and 90&#176; (e.g. gradient = 1:100, 1:1, 1:0,5). A vertical cliff has an angle of 90&#176; (gradient = 1:0). Very few places are either completely flat or covered by the slopes of hills and mountains. Most landscapes are a combination of slopes that collectively make up different landforms. V-shaped valley: the river has carved its course so deeply through the surrounding rocks that the sides of the valley form almost vertical cliffs. Gorge (kloof ): a gorge is a &#8220;blind&#8221; steep V-shaped valley where the sides of the V are very close together. Spur: many contour lines bend in a V-shape but the V points (like an arrowhead) to lower ground. Concave slope: from the mountain top, the slope falls away steeply and then becomes gentler further down the slope. The upper slope elements have a large slope angle; the lower slope elements have a small slope angle. Cliff: the contour lines are so close together that they overlap. Escarpment: the contour pattern changes abruptly, from well spaced at the top of the plateau to very close together, showing the steep cliffs of an escarpment. Valley: many contour lines bend in a V-shape. The V points (like an arrowhead) to higher ground, from where water will flow downhill when it rains. Notice the blue line that indicates a watercourse. A solid blue line shows the course of a perennial river, a dashed blue line a non-perennial river. Plateau: widely spaced contours show flat, high-lying land. 17</p>
